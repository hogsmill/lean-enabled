      Agile Simulations Subscriptions
    </h2>
    <p>
      As many of you are aware, we have been developing online versions of agile games, workshops and activities
      and we're keen to make these as widely available as we can. We are very keen to see Agile Coaches and Scrum
      Masters using them as part of their everyday work with teams, or as part of their transformational
      service offerings.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the games are designed with 2 things in mind:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        To be as engaging, and as close to the "face-to-face" experience as possible. In some ways, they are even
        better than the "real thing".
      </li>
      <li>
        To demonstrate aspects of an agile mindset so we can allow players to uncover new and interesting ways of
        thinking.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      (<i>for example of games being "better than the real thing", see, for instance</i> -
      <a href="https://kanbanzone.com/2021/what-we-learned-from-taking-agile-workshops-online/">

        Making feedback engaging and relevant by taking agile workshops online
      </a>)
    </p>
    <p>
      However, running software versions of games comes with various costs, so we do need to charge a small - but
      albeit hopefully manageable - subscription to allow you to use all the features of all the games.
    </p>
    <p>
      The reason we chose a subscription model was to allow you to pay once, and then have access to <em>all</em>
      the games and workshops whenever the need arises; we don't want anyone not using a game when a situation
      calls for it because they haven't purchased that particular game, and won't be able to get access in time.
      Also, we want you all to try all the games as much, and as often, as possible. We have also tried to make it as
      easy as possible for Scrum Masters and Agile Coach who are perm employees to be able to justify purchasing a
      subscription by adding useful activities that can be run (e.g.) monthly; this should make it an easier sell.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are two types of games. Some are one-off "as and when the need arises" games, which can be used as stand-alone
      workshops/meetings, or as part of retros, training courses, etc. They are usually used to really hammer home an agile
      mindset concept through gamification; getting players to come to a realisation without realising it because they were
      concentrating on playing the game and having fun... We have found the games particularly useful to break
      things up and increase engagement during online training courses or meetings, and these seem to be more and more common in
      these days of increased remote/WFH/WFO working. Examples are:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The <a href="https://agilesimulations.co.uk/coin-game?walkThrough">
          Coin Game
        </a>.
      </li>
      <li>
        The <a href="https://agilesimulations.co.uk/no-estimates/?walkThrough">
          No Estimates
        </a> game/workshop.
      </li>
      <li>
        The <a href="https://agilesimulations.co.uk/context-switching/?walkThrough">
          Context Switching
        </a> game.
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="https://agilesimulations.co.uk/battleships?walkThrough">
          Agile Battleships
        </a>.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      ...among others. Other games/activities are the kind of thing you would use on a regular basis, either to check on
      aspects of teams or individuals, or as part of your workflow. Examples are:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The <a href="https://agilesimulations.co.uk/team-health-check">
          Spotify Health Check
        </a> - this includes full aggregation and trending as well as rich functionality
        to analyse and present results.
      </li>
      <li>
        The <a href="https://agilesimulations.co.uk/five-dysfunctions">
          5 Dysfunctions of a Team
        </a> assessment. As with the Health Check, this can be run at regular
        intervals to see progress or identify issues, and has full trending and
        aggregation functionality.
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="https://agilesimulations.co.uk/planning-poker">
          Planning Poker
        </a> - this allows explorations beyond the usual story points to hopefully
        allow teams to think differently about how they estimate.
      </li>

      <h4>
        Discovering your Agile Mindset through Gamification
      </h4>
      <p>
        Mindset drives behaviour, and, therefor, influencing mindset is the key to any succesful transformation.
      </p>
      <p>
        This workshop concentrates on developing, or, hopefully, uncovering, your agile mindset through the playing of games.
        We all know that it is easier to learn something by experiencing it rather than being taught or shown it. Gamification
        takes this idea a step further; we can isolate the experience we want to concentrate on away from the messy, complex,
        real world, and participants can discover the concept for themselves without realising it. And, of course, it's all
        very engaging and just good fun...
      </p>
      <p>
        As part of the workshop, participants will get full host access to all the games - and others - that they can use it
        in their organisations to help others to discover their agile mindsets.
      </p>
      <p>
        We hope to unearth 5 aspects of agile thinking - and these are by no means all aspects of it - through 5 online games
      </p>
      <h5>
        1) Agile is all about delivering value to the customer as quickly as possible
      </h5>
      <p>
        Unlike traditional, project-based software delivery, agile concerns itself with creating a continuous stream of value to the
        customer;  there is no project start or end. To maximise this value stream, and to attempt to stay ahead of competitors doing
        the same, we need to always deliver the next highest value item to our customers. Furthermore, at some point we end up
        delivering so little value, we may as well pivot and do something else. This is very different to project based thinking,
        where success means every requirement - regardless of it's value - has been delivered in a pre-determined order from a plan.
      </p>
      <p>
        We can explore why this strategy is sensible using the <a href="https://agilesimulations.co.uk/coin-game?walkThrough">Coin Game</a>.
        Note, this is most likely *not* the coin game you have played previously...
      </p>
      <h5>
        2) We can only know if we are delivering value if we get rapid feedback
      </h5>
      <p>
        Agile is often (<i>incorrectly</i>) seen as a way to deliver stuff faster. However, it doesn't really matter how fast we deliver
        stuff if we don't get feedback on whether what we are delivering is the most useful thing for our customers. Delivering without
        feedback is like playing golf in the dark; we have no idea whether we are getting nearer the hole if we can't see where the
        ball is landing.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://agilesimulations.co.uk/battleships?walkThrough">Agile Battleships</a> is a version of the classic game with an
        agile twist to demonstrate just how important feedback is to success.
      </p>
      <h5>
        3) What is more important, delivering quality, or speed of learning?
      </h5>
      <p>
        If we want to deliver high quality product, we should always fix every bug before releasing; that's a no-brainer, right? Or is it?
        What if doing that slows down how quickly we can learn what the customer actually wants? What if we spend a long time triaging,
        fixing and re-testing a bug and the customer never finds it? What if it is in a feature the customer never uses, and didn't
        want in the first place?
      </p>
      <p>
        In the Pipeline Game (<i>Under construction</i>), we explore this trade-off between quality and speed of learning, and it's not as
        clear-cut as you might think...
      </p>
      <h5>
        4) We need to be single-minded about delivering - stop starting and start finishing
      </h5>
      <p>
        From a developer's perspective (<i>and probably everyone else's</i>), there is nothing worse than being interrupted when you're
        "in the zone". Research shows that a 2 minute interruption can take 30 to 40 minutes to recover from. If you're getting interrupted
        every half an hour, it's easy to see how productivity can be severely impacted by this context switching. The same is true if
        people are trying to work simultaneously on multiple things.
      </p>
      <p>
        We can demonstrate this very easily by playing the <a href="https://agilesimulations.co.uk/context-switching/?walkThrough">Context Switching</a>
        game.
      </p>
      <h5>
        5) We need to relentlessly reduce waste - don't do anything that doesn't deliver value
      </h5>
      <p>
        If we are going to maximise value delivery as discussed above, we need to be as efficient as possible in our delivery This means eliminating
        waste. Basically, we need to ask ourselves; is this thing we are doing - be it writing documents, generating reports, estimating delivery
        dates, waiting for sign-offs, whatever - helping us deliver value to our customers? If not, why are we doing it?
      </p>
      <p>
        We will demonstrate this idea through the example of the waste of estimation and the
        <a href="https://agilesimulations.co.uk/no-estimates/?walkThrough">No Estimates</a> game. This will demonstrate why estimation is
        futile (<i>it will always be wrong</i>), and, from that, how we can do something more scientific and accurate that eradicates the waste.
      </p>
      <h4>
        What this workshop will not teach you
      </h4>
      <p>
        This workshop is about using gamification to explore (not teach...) some - and by no means all - aspects of an agile mindset. It will
        *not* teach you:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          How agile frameworks work and how to apply them
        </li>
        <li>
          How you should work; it's about how you might think
        </li>
        <li>
          How to "do" agile; if anything, it helps you "be" agile
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        You will not get a certificate. If you're interested in having an agile mindset (rather than using agile as a process), you won't need one...
      </p>
      <h4>
        What this workshop will give you
      </h4>
      <p>
        As well as (hopefully) discovering your agile mindset, you will get full host access to all the games on the course, and all others at
        the <a href="https://agilesimulation.co.uk">Agile Simulations</a> web site. Host access gives you a dedicated, protected (virtual) server
        just for your organisation, and opens up a full suite of configuration options so you can tailor the games to be even more relevant to
        your organisaton/circumstances. This includes:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Configure Kanban boards to your workflows; columns, blocking rates, WIP policies, etc.
        </li>
        <li>
          Configure team names, logos, membership etc. to your organisational set up
        </li>
        <li>
          Company logos, branding, etc.
        </li>
        <li>
          Currencies, coin denominations, etc
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        ...among others. We will also provide support and facilitation help so you can get the most out of the games.
